How to run 

./orderprocessor input


Note

* OrderBookManager::instance().print(cout) is currently commmented out,
 which can print out all OrderBooks.

* For example, OrderBookManager::instance().print(cout, "ABB")
  can be used to print out one OrderBook

* The mapping between "symbol" and "OrderBook" is implemented by using Trie

* In each side of OrderBook, there are:
  multimap:   save the mapping from "price" to "size, orderID" pair
  map (using hash_map will be better): save the mapping from "orderID" to "multimap::iterator"
  
  The running time for Add, Mod, Del are all no more than Log(N)
