Given a set of Add, Modify and Delete order operations build the limit order book.
Order book is a level-2 book, with the total size and order count at each price level.
Input is a text file, with one order op per line (Add, Mod or Del); fields are pipe (‘|’) delimited.
Note: side is either S or B (Sell or Buy respectively); op is A, M or D (Add, Mod or Del respectively).
Note: input contains many symbols.
 
 
Sample Add order op (Symbol|Op|Side|OrderId|OrderSize|OrderPrice):
ABB|A|S|343453|5800|21.1300
 
Sample Mod order op (Symbol|Op|OrderId|NewOrderSize|NewOrderPrice):
ABB|M|343453|100|21.1300
 
Sample Del order op (Symbol|Op|OrderId):
ABB|D|343453
 
Provide a “print” facility to print both sides of the book, given a symbol.
 
Note: please ask for clarification, should anything be unclear, _before_ submitting the code.
 
Please don’t use any c++ facilities not present in c++98.
Please put the code on GitHub where we can access it.

1.       All capital letters
2.       Depth is not limited
3.       Each op comes with the order number it applies to. If no order with given order number exists, the op must be rejected.
4.       Print best buy, best sell, followed by second best buy, and second best sell, and so on.
5.       It can be called at any time (between order ops), but you don’t call it; just provide the definition.
6.       No. You only need to keep track of the total size and number of orders –this is what the “level-2” book is.
 
The format of the printout is not really important, but it would be nice to have it in the form where it is easy to “see” the book.
Perhaps:
 
                OrderCtn TotalSz Price – Price TotalSz OrderCnt (3 450 43.55 – 43.56 100 1)
 
Bid on the left of ‘-‘, Ask on the right, starting with best bid and best offer on line 1, followed by second best bid and second best offer on line 2, and so on.


Several Questions:

1. Can ticker symbol be assumed all "Capital Letter", or just "Letter", or just "Number or Letter", or no assumption?

2. Is depth of the book limited to something like "10", or it is unlimited? Is there any maximum depth?

3. If op Mod/Del order comes before op Add (probably out of sequence), should I ignore the Mod/Del, or I need to cache the Mod/Del op until we receive the Add op, then process after the Add op.
But if op Mol and Del are out of sequence, cache approach will not work. What's the rule for this situation?

4. I assume when we print out, we need to print in a best BUY price and best SELL price order? 

5. How often "print" function is used? Do we need to print after every update?

6. As mentioned, at each price level, it is the total size and order count. So if two orders in the same side have the same price, for example, 
ABB|A|S|343453|100|21.1300
ABB|A|S|343454|200|21.1300

total size is 300, and order count 2. 

But do I also need to print out each order, or just "price, total size, order count"?

I assume the following format. Can you give an example format of the printout if you prefer?

ABB|BuyPrice1,BuySize1,BuyOrderCount1,BuyPrice2,BuySize2,BuyOrderCount2,...|SellPrice1,SellSize1,SellOrderCount1,SellPrice2,SellSize2,SellOrderCount2,...
